# Csv-reader-project
This program is written in Python and is used to read student data from a CSV file.
The CSV file contains information such as student names, ages, and scores.
The program begins by importing the CSV module, which helps in reading CSV files.
A function is created to process the student data from the given file.
The file is opened safely so that errors can be handled properly.
If the file does not exist, the program shows an error message.
The CSV data is read using column names instead of index numbers.
All rows from the file are stored in a list for easy processing.
The program checks if the CSV file is empty.
If no data is found, it prints an error message and stops execution.
After that, a table heading is printed to display student details neatly.
The program prepares variables to calculate total scores and store results.
Each student record is read one by one.
The name, age, and score are taken from the CSV file.
The score is converted into a number for calculations.
Student details are printed in a formatted table row.
The program adds each score to calculate the total score.
Students are divided into high, middle, and low score groups.
High score students have scores of 80 or above.
Middle score students have scores between 71 and 79.
Low score students have scores of 70 or below.
After processing all students, a summary section is printed.
The total number of students is displayed.
The average score is calculated and shown.
Finally, the names of students in each score category are printed.
The program also handles missing files, missing columns, and invalid data.
This makes the program safe, reliable, and easy to use.
